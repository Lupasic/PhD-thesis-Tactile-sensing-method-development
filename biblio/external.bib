  abstract = {The medial axis transform (or MAT) is a representation of an object as an infinite union of balls. We consider approximating the MAT of a three-dimensional object, and its complement, with a finite union of balls. Using this approximate MAT we define a new piecewise-linear approximation to the object surface, which we call the power crust. We assume that we are given as input a sufficiently dense sample of points from the object surface. We select a subset of the Voronoi balls of the sample, the polar balls, as the union of balls representation. We bound the geometric error of the union, and of the corresponding power crust, and show that both representations are topologically correct as well. Thus, our results provide a new algorithm for surface reconstruction from sample points. By construction, the power crust is always the boundary of a polyhedral solid, so we avoid the polygonization, hole-filling or manifold extraction steps used in previous algorithms. The union of balls representation and the power crust have corresponding piecewise-linear dual representations, which in some sense approximate the medial axis. We show a geometric relationship between these duals and the medial axis by proving that, as the sampling density goes to infinity, the set of poles, the centers of the polar balls, converges to the medial axis.},

  abstract = {Abstract A convex polytope P can be specified in two ways: as the convex hull of the vertex set V of P, or as the intersection of the set H of its facet-inducing halfspaces. The vertex enumeration problem is to compute V from H{$>$}. The facet enumeration problem is to compute H from V. These two problems are essentially equivalent under point/hyperplane duality. They are among the central computational problems in the theory of polytopes. It is open whether they can be solved in time polynomial in |H| + |V| and the dimension. In this paper we consider the main known classes of algorithms for solving these problems. We argue that they all have at least one of two weaknesses: inability to deal well with “degeneracies”, or, inability to control the sizes of intermediate results. We then introduce families of polytopes that exercise those weaknesses. Roughly speaking, fat-lattice or intricate polytopes cause algorithms with bad degeneracy handling to perform badly; dwarfed polytopes cause algorithms with bad intermediate size control to perform badly. We also present computational experience with trying to solve these problem on these hard polytopes, using various implementations of the main algorithms.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

Empirical observation of robot hardware is needed because ground impedance and foot-ground interaction is challenging to predict in simulation. This paper presents experimental data of the MIT Super Mini Cheetah robot hopping on hard and soft ground. We show that controllers tuned for each surface perform better for each specific surface type, assessing performance using measurements of 1.) stability of the robot in response to self-disturbances applied by the robot onto itself and 2.) the peak accelerations of the robot that occur during ground impact, which should be minimized to reduce mechanical stress. To aid in controller selection on different ground types, we show that the robot can measure ground stiffness and friction in-situ by measuring its own interaction with the ground. To motivate future work in variable-terrain control and in-situ ground measurement, we show preliminary results of running gaits that transition between hard and soft ground.},

So it's directly up and the exact opposite direction of gravity! Whereas, an accelerometer in free fall would measure no acceleration at all even though it would be accelerating. So the "convert to angle" block would also take care of this sign flip. Don't forget to subscribe!

The space usage of the data structure is O(n). The data structure supports extreme point queries in a given direction, tangent queries through a given point, and queries for the neighboring points on the convex hull in O(log n) time. The extreme point queries can be used to decide whether or not a given line intersects the convex hull, and the tangent queries to determine whether a given point is inside the convex hull. We give a lower bound on the amortized asymptotic time complexity that matches the performance of this data structure.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new force sensor design approach that maps the local sampling of pressure inside a composite polymeric footpad to forces in three axes, designed for running robots. Conventional multiaxis force sensors made of heavy metallic materials tend to be too bulky and heavy to be fitted in the feet of legged robots, and vulnerable to inertial noise upon high acceleration. To satisfy the requirements for high speed running, which include mitigating high impact forces, protecting the sensors from ground collision, and enhancing traction, these stiff sensors should be paired with additional layers of durable, soft materials; but this also degrades the integrity of the foot structure. The proposed foot sensor is manufactured as a monolithic, composite structure composed of an array of barometric pressure sensors completely embedded in a protective polyurethane rubber layer. This composite architecture allows the layers to provide compliance and traction for foot collision while the deformation and the sampled pressure distribution of the structure can be mapped into three axis force measurement. Normal and shear forces can be measured upon contact with the ground, which causes the footpad to deform and change the readings of the individual pressure sensors in the array. A one-time training process using an artificial neural network is all that is necessary to relate the normal and shear forces with the multiaxis foot sensor output. The results show that the sensor can predict normal forces in the Z-axis up to 300 N with a root mean squared error of 0.66\% and up to 80 N in the X- and Y -axis. The experiment results demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a lightweight, low cost, yet robust footpad sensor suitable for use in legged robots undergoing ground locomotion.},

Focusing only on worst case analysis or asymptotic computations leads to the development of complex data structures or hard to implement algorithms. Randomized algorithms appear in this scenario as a very useful tool in order to obtain easier implementations within a good expected time bound. However, parallel implementations of these algorithms are hard to develop and require an in-depth understanding of the language, the compiler and the underlying parallel computer architecture. In this paper we show how we can use speculative parallelization techniques to execute in parallel iterative algorithms such as randomized incremental constructions. In this paper we focus on the convex hull problem, and show that, using our speculative parallelization engine, the sequential algorithm can be automatically executed in parallel, obtaining speedups with as little as four processors, and reaching 5.15x speedup with 28 processors.},

The algorithm requires O ( n ) space in the worst case. Another algorithm computes the convex hull of a point set in E 3 in O ( n log A ) expected time, where n is the number of points and A is the number of points on the surface of the hull. A simple Las Vegas algorithm triangulates simple polygons in O ( n log log n ) expected time. Algorithms for half-space range reporting are also given.

  abstract = {This paper presents a simple, flexible, and efficient algorithm for constructing a possibly non-convex, simple polygon that characterizes the shape of a set of input points in the plane, termed a characteristic shape. The algorithm is based on the Delaunay triangulation of the points. The shape produced by the algorithm is controlled by a single normalized parameter, which can be used to generate a finite, totally ordered family of related characteristic shapes, varying between the convex hull at one extreme and a uniquely defined shape with minimum area. An optimal O(nlogn) algorithm for computing the shapes is presented. Characteristic shapes possess a number of desirable properties, and the paper includes an empirical investigation of the shapes produced by the algorithm. This investigation provides experimental evidence that with appropriate parameterization the algorithm is able to accurately characterize the shape of a wide range of different point distributions and densities. The experiments detail the effects of changing parameter values and provide an indication of some ”good” parameter values to use in certain circumstances.},

  abstract = {The progress observed in ‘soft robotics’ brought some promising research in flexible tactile, pressure and force sensors, which can be based on polymeric composite materials. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to evaluate the characteristics of a force-sensitive material—polyethylene-carbon composite (Velostat®) by implementing this material into the design of the flexible tactile sensor. We have explored several possibilities to measure the electrical signal and assessed the mechanical and time-dependent properties of this tactile sensor. The response of the sensor was evaluated by performing tests in static, long-term load and cyclic modes. Experimental results of loading cycle measurements revealed the hysteresis and nonlinear properties of the sensor. The transverse resolution of the sensor was defined by measuring the response of the sensor at different distances from the loaded point. Obtained dependencies of the sensor’s sensitivity, hysteresis, response time, transversal resolution and deformation on applied compressive force promise a practical possibility to use the polyethylene-carbon composite as a sensitive material for sensors with a single electrode pair or its matrix. The results received from experimental research have defined the area of the possible implementation of the sensor based on a composite material—Velostat®.},

  abstract = {Clustering depends critically on density and distance (similarity), but these concepts become increasingly more difficult to define as dimensionality increases. In this paper we offer definitions of density and similarity that work well for high dimensional data (actually, for data of any dimensionality). In particular, we use a similarity measure that is based on the number of neighbors that two points share, and define the density of a point as the sum of the similarities of a point’s nearest neighbors. We then present a new clustering algorithm that is based on these ideas. This algorithm eliminates noise (low density points) and builds clusters by associating non-noise points with representative or core points (high density points). This approach handles many problems that traditionally plague clustering algorithms, e.g., finding clusters in the presence of noise and outliers and finding clusters in data that has clusters of different shapes, sizes, and density. We have used our clustering algorithm on a variety of high and low dimensional data sets with good results, but in this paper, we present only a couple of examples involving high dimensional data sets: word clustering and time series derived from NASA Earth science data.},

We worked with the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot. Our approach was initially targeted at walking, and it consisted of two levels of optimization: a high-level trajectory optimizer that reasons about center of mass and swing foot trajectories, and a low-level controller that tracks those trajectories by solving floating base full body inverse dynamics using quadratic programming. This controller is capable of walking on rough terrain, and it also achieves long footsteps, fast walking speeds, and heel-strike and toe-off in simulation. During development of these and other whole body tasks on the physical robot, we introduced an additional optimization component in the low-level controller, namely an inverse kinematics controller. Modeling and torque measurement errors and hardware features of the Atlas robot led us to this three-part approach, which was applied to three tasks in the DRC Trials in December 2013.},

I present a suite of tools for understanding high dimensional prediction functions that are based on the Functional ANOVA decomposition and argue that these are optimal in an idealized setting. I then show that they can be distorted to an arbitrary extent if the predictor space contains large regions of extrapolation. This thesis gives a criterion of extrapolation and details tree-based methods to evaluate it. This methodology provides a comprehensible representation of the distribution of training data and a diagnostic for functional behavior in regions of low data density. I then discuss the issue of making predictions at points of extrapolation. I suggest a strategy for stabilizing a general learning algorithm away from training data that is motivated by a Bayesian heuristic not unlike ridge regression and which bears some resemblance to Kriging. Finally, I advocate a modification to the Functional ANOVA that uses this estimate to avoid the effects of bad extrapolation while retaining many of the useful properties of the decomposition. All the ideas in this work are designed to be fully general and compatible with any machine learning algorithm.},

The extrapolation model attempts to accurately estimate the high-level trend of the data, which can be extended in a natural way. The constraints of monotonicity and convexity/concavity play an important role in restricting the choice of the high level-trend, which otherwise would remain rather arbitrary. Our extrapolation model incorporates these constraints in multiple dimensions. We describe the trend as a nonnegative linear combination of twice-integrated multivariate B-splines and their variations. The specific basis functions in our approach are chosen so that any such combination is a plausible a priori model. As a result, basis function coefficients can be optimized to best fit the data without losing control over the high-level trend of the extrapolation model. Our approach also allows the use of standard model selection techniques. We illustrate this by applying cross-va...},

  abstract = {There has historically been very little concern with extrapolation in Machine Learning, yet extrapolation can be critical to diagnose. Predictor functions are almost always learned on a set of highly correlated data comprising a very small segment of predictor space. Moreover, flexible predictors, by their very nature, are not controlled at points of extrapolation. This becomes a problem for diagnostic tools that require evaluation on a product distribution. It is also an issue when we are trying to optimize a response over some variable in the input space. Finally, it can be a problem in non-static systems in which the underlying predictor distribution gradually drifts with time or when typographical errors misrecord the values of some predictors.We present a diagnosis for extrapolation as a statistical test for a point originating from the data distribution as opposed to a null hypothesis uniform distribution. This allows us to employ general classification methods for estimating such a test statistic. Further, we observe that CART can be modified to accept an exact distribution as an argument, providing a better classification tool which becomes our extrapolation-detection procedure. We explore some of the advantages of this approach and present examples of its practical application.},

With the dawn of computerized technology, the terrain is represented in a digital form and new methods are needed to effectively describe, evaluate and quantify terrain properties. The purpose of this project is to develop new methods and procedures for terrain analyses within a GIS environment. The focus is to develop tools for capturing the local terrain variability. The selected parameters such as the hypsometric integral (modified Martonne's index), roughness index, and basic statistical measures (mean, range and variance) are combined with newly developed dissectivity parameters, drainage lengths and landuse characteristics in one unified package and programmed in GIS using the ARC Macro Language (AML). The digital terrain data from this analysis can then be correlated with other spatial information to determine the influence of terrain properties on the ecosystem or other variables of interest including the human systems.},

These patches are intended to provide a reasonable set of choices for higher-level footfall selection algorithms, and are pre-filtered for several attributes—including location, curvature, and normal—that we observed humans to prefer. Input is from a 640 × 480 depth camera augmented with a 9-DoF inertial measurement unit to sense the direction of gravity. The system is capable of finding approximately 700 patches/second on commodity hardware, though the intention is not to find as many patches as possible but to reasonably sample upcoming terrain with quality patches. Sixty recordings of human subjects traversing rocky trails were analyzed to give a baseline for target patch properties. While the presented system is not designed to select a single foothold, it does find a set of patches for possible footholds which are statistically similar to the patches humans select.},

Their sensor values are affected by the crawling gait period, therefore, certain components of the fast Fourier transform over these data are included in the feature vectors as well as remarkable discriminative power is observed for the same scalar statistics of different sensing modalities. The machine learning aspects are analyzed with random forests (RF) because of their stable performance and some inherent, beneficial properties for the model development process. The robustness is evaluated with unseen data after the model accuracy is estimated with cross-validation (CV), and regardless whether a Sony ERS-7 walks barefoot or wears socks, the forests achieve 94\% accuracy. This result outperforms the state of the art techniques for indoor surfaces in the literature and the classification execution is real-time on the robot. The above mentioned model development process with RF is documented to create new models for other robots more quickly and efficiently.},

  abstract = {We address the problem that occurs when inferences about counterfactuals—predictions, ‘‘what-if’’ questions, and causal effects—are attempted far from the available data. The danger of these extreme counterfactuals is that substantive conclusions drawn from statistical models that fit the data well turn out to be based largely on speculation hidden in convenient modeling assumptions that few would be willing to defend. Yet existing statistical strategies provide few reliable means of identifying extreme counterfactuals. We offer a proof that inferences farther from the data allow more model dependence and then develop easyto-apply methods to evaluate how model dependent our answers would be to specified counterfactuals. These methods require neither sensitivity testing over specified classes of models nor evaluating any specific modeling assumptions. If an analysis fails the simple tests we offer, then we know that substantive results are sensitive to at least some modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence. Free software that accompanies this article implements all the methods developed.},

The illustrations explain how the particular parts of the construction work, and also show the final surfaces of the obtained models. The method is tested on artificial datasets generated from mathematical functions according to various statistical distributions.

Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},

Vision-based approaches have failed to reliably predict soil characteristics in the past, making it necessary to probe the terrain tactilely. We present a robust, haptic inspection approach for a variety of fine, granular media, which are representative of Martian soil. In our approach, the robot uses one limb to perform an impact trajectory, while supporting the main body with the remaining three legs. The resulting vibration, which is recorded by sensors placed in the foot, is decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and assigned a soil class by a support vector machine. We tested two foot designs and validated the robustness of this approach through the extensive use of an open-source dataset, which we recorded on a specially designed single-foot testbed. A remarkable overall classification accuracy of more than 98\% could be achieved despite various introduced disturbances. The contributions of different sensors to the classification performance are evaluated. Finally, we test the generalization performance on unknown soils and show that the interaction behavior can be anticipated.},

  abstract = {This study provides a synthetic viewpoint that compares, contrasts, and draws commonalities for biomimetic perception over a range of tactile sensors and tactile stimuli. Biomimetic active perception is formulated from three principles: (i) evidence accumulation based on leading models of perceptual decision making; (ii) action selection with an evidence-based policy, here based on overt focal attention; and (iii) sensory encoding of evidence based on neural coding. Two experiments with each of three biomimetic tactile sensors are considered: the iCub (capacitive) fingertip, the TacTip (optical) tactile sensor, and BIOTACT whiskers. For each sensor, one experiment considers a similar task (perception of shape and location) and the other a different tactile perception task. In all experiments, active perception with a biomimetic action selection policy based on focal attention outperforms passive perception with static or random action selection. The active perception also consistently reaches superresolved accuracy (hyperacuity) finer than the spacing between tactile elements. Biomimetic active touch thus offers a common approach for biomimetic tactile sensors to accurately and robustly characterize and explore non-trivial, uncertain environments analogous to how animals perceive the natural world.},

In effect, with the exception of a posteriori adjustments of the expansion components, the definition of this parameter is the only way of improving the approximation at a finite distance from the initial point. Good parametrization equations are usually obtained by norms that involve all variables of the problem or based on the nature of the mechanical phenomena. Here this equation is constructed following the criteria of reducing the residual error and at the same time exactly reproducing solutions that admit a polynomial second degree representation. That choice is automatic in the analysis and improves the domain of accurate approximations. An appropriate predictor–corrector scheme was implemented to compare extrapolations obtained by this and several standard parametrizations. The solution scheme was used to analyse geometrically nonlinear plane frame structures.},

To this end, roboticists have, in the last few decades, developed several tactile sensing solutions, extensively reported in the literature. Research into interpreting the conveyed tactile information has also started to attract increasing attention in recent years. However, a comprehensive study on this topic is yet to be reported. In an effort to collect and summarize the major scientific achievements in the area, this survey extensively reviews current trends in robot tactile perception of object properties. Available tactile sensing technologies are briefly presented before an extensive review on tactile recognition of object properties. The object properties that are targeted by this review are shape, surface material and object pose. The role of touch sensing in combination with other sensing sources is also discussed. In this review, open issues are identified and future directions for applying tactile sensing in different tasks are suggested.},

  title = {An Efficient Orientation Filter for Inertial and Inertial/Magnetic Sensor Arrays},
  author = {Madgwick, Sebastian O H},
  pages = {32},
  abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation filter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {$<$} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {$<$} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

It also covers a few scenarios that illustrate the various ways that sensor fusion can be implemented. Sensor fusion is a critical part of localization and positioning, as well as detection and object tracking. We’ll show that sensor fusion is more than just a Kalman filter; it is a whole range of algorithms that can blend data from multiple sources to get a better estimate of the system state. Four of the main benefits of sensor fusion are to improve measurement quality, reliability, and coverage, as well as be able to estimate states that aren’t measure directly. The fact that sensor fusion has this broad appeal across completely different types of autonomous systems is what makes it an interesting and rewarding topic to learn.

First, we note limitations of existing formal theories. Next, we develop several potential formal models of function learning, which include expansion of classic rule-based approaches and associative-based models. We specify for the first time psychologically based learning mechanisms for the rule models. We then present new, rigorous tests of these competing models that take into account order of difficulty for learning different function forms and extrapolation performance. Critically, detailed learning performance was also used to conduct the model evaluations. The results favor a hybrid model that combines associative learning of trained input—prediction pairs with a rule-based output response for extrapolation (EXAM).},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of terrain classification using a technically blind hexapod walking robot. The proposed approach is built on top of the existing method based on analysis of the feedback from the robot’s actuators and the desired trajectory. The formed method uses features for the Support Vector Machine classification method that assumes a regular time-invariant gait to control the robot. However, such a gait does not allow the robot to traverse rough terrains, and therefore, it is necessary to consider adaptive motion gait to deal with small obstacles, which is, unfortunately, not a regular gait with some fixed predefined period. Therefore, we propose to alter the features extraction process to utilize the terrain classification method also for an adaptive motion gait, which enables the robot to traverse rough terrains. The proposed method has been experimentally verified on several terrains that are not traversable by a default regular gait. The achieved results not only confirmed the high accuracy of the terrain classification as the existing approach, but also expanded the area of operation of a hexapod walking robot into more challenging terrains.},

  abstract = {Terrain identification is a key enabling ability for generating terrain adaptive behaviors that assist both robot planning and motor control. This paper considers running legged robots from the RHex family, which the military plans to use in the field to assist troops in reconnaissance tasks. Important terrain adaptive behaviors include the selection of gaits, modulation of leg stiffness, and alteration of steering control laws that minimize slippage, maximize speed and/or reduce energy consumption. These terrain adaptive behaviors can be enabled by a terrain identification methodology that combines proprioceptive sensors already available in RHex-type robots. The proposed classification approach is based on the characteristic frequency signatures of data from leg observers, which combine current sensing with a dynamic model of the leg motion. The paper analyzes the classification accuracy obtained using both a single leg and groups of legs (through a voting scheme) on different terrains such as vinyl, asphalt, grass, and pebbles. Additionally, it presents a terrain classifier that works across various gait speeds and in fact almost as good as an overly specialized classifier.},

Concave hull performs better than convex hull, but it is difficult to formulate and few algorithms are suggested. Especially, an n-dimensional concave hull is more difficult than a 2- or 3-dimensional one. In this paper, we propose a new concave hull algorithm for n-dimensional datasets. It is simple but creative. We show its application to dataset analysis. We also suggest a concaveness measure and a graph that captures geometric shape of an n-dimensional dataset. Proposed concave hull algorithm and concaveness measure/graph are implemented using java, and are posted to http://user.dankook.ac.kr/\textasciitilde bitl/dkuCH.},

Here k is the number of regressor variables used to build the regression model.

Three of the hulls have worst-case time complexity Θ(n + f) and worst case space complexity θ(n) space, where n is the number of edges of a given polygon and f (≥2) is the number of allowed orientations. We also show that testing whether an arbitrary simple polygon is (finitely oriented) convex has worst-case time and space complexity θ(n + f) and θ(n), respectively.},

Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

  abstract = {A key challenge in autonomous planetary surface exploration is the extraction of meaningful information from sensor data, which would allow a good interpretation of the nearby terrain, and a reasonable assessment of more distant areas. In the last decade, the desire to increase the autonomy of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), particularly in terms of off-road navigation, has significantly increased the interest in the field of automated terrain classification. Although the field is relatively new, its advances and goals are scattered across different robotic platforms and applications. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of the field from a planetary exploration perspective, bringing together the underlying techniques, existing approaches and relevant applications under a common framework. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview to the newcomer in the field, and a structured reference for the practitioners.},

RHex has only six actuators—one motor located at each hip— achieving mechanical simplicity that promotes reliable and robust operation in real-world tasks. Empirically stable and highly maneuverable locomotion arises from a very simple clock-driven, open-loop tripod gait. The legs rotate full circle, thereby preventing the common problem of toe stubbing in the protraction (swing) phase. An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation. RHex achieves fast and robust forward locomotion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body clearance.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the kinematics of a legged robot with half-circular leg morphology. In particular, our focus is on the RHex hexapod platform. A new kinematic model for RHex is developed considering the leg shape and its consequences, which was over simplified in the previous models seen in literature. The formulation is an accurate kinematic representation of the robot in the sagittal plane that is based on a four-link mechanism analogy. When only pure rolling motion of the legs are considered, it is found that when front and rear pairs of legs are in contact with the ground, the robot becomes a one degree-offreedom mechanism and position of the middle pair of legs are redundant. The problem is solved in two steps; the first one being the determination of the initial configuration of the leg angular positions which defines the initial value of the variable distance of the front and rear leg and ground contact ponts. After the initial configuration of the system is set, pitch angle of the robot body can be manipulated by controlling one of the leg angular positions and the results are presented on an example case; positioning a body fixed unactuated sensor by controlling robot body pitch angle through the actuation of one of the legs. The results are a good display of the multi-functional aspect of the legs in addition to their use for locomotion.},

  abstract = {Autonomous microhelicopters will soon play a major role in tasks like search and rescue, environment monitoring, security surveillance, and inspection. If they are further realized in small scale, they can also be used in narrow outdoor and indoor environments and represent only a limited risk for people. However, for such operations, navigating based only on global positioning system (GPS) information is not sufficient. Fully autonomous operation in cities or other dense environments requires microhelicopters to fly at low altitudes, where GPS signals are often shadowed, or indoors and to actively explore unknown environments while avoiding collisions and creating maps. This involves a number of challenges on all levels of helicopter design, perception, actuation, control, and navigation, which still have to be solved. The Swarm of Micro Flying Robots (SFLY) project was a European Union-funded project with the goal of creating a swarm of vision-controlled microaerial vehicles (MAVs) capable of autonomous navigation, three-dimensional (3-D) mapping, and optimal surveillance coverage in GPS-denied environments. The SFLY MAVs do not rely on remote control, radio beacons, or motion-capture systems but can fly all by themselves using only a single onboard camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). This article describes the technical challenges that have been faced and the results achieved from hardware design and embedded programming to vision-based navigation and mapping, with an overview of how all the modules work and how they have been integrated into the final system. Code, data sets, and videos are publicly available to the robotics community. Experimental results demonstrating three MAVs navigating autonomously in an unknown GPS-denied environment and performing 3-D mapping and optimal surveillance coverage are presented.},

  abstract = {© 2015 IEEE. Agile and versatile legged robots are expected to become useful machines for applications in unstructured environments where traditional vehicles with wheels and tracks cannot go. Hydraulic actuation has proven to be a suitable actuation technology due to its high power density, robustness against impacts and high stiffness for high bandwidth control. In this paper we demonstrate how additive manufacturing (AM) can produce highly integrated hydraulic components with reduced weight and higher complexity when compared to traditionally manufactured manifolds. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first time a successful implementation of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) of hydraulic manifolds made in aluminium alloy AlSiMg is presented. AlSiMg has several advantages for the construction of hydraulic components when compared to the commonly used Titanium alloys (e.g. Ti64): lower cost, higher thermal conductivity, lower density and easier to post-process. This paper first explains the build process with DMLS of AlSiMg and a pre-study of a pressure-tested hydraulic tube that demonstrated the suitability of AlSiMg for AM hydraulic components. Then, we discuss part orientation and support material during the build process of a highly-integrated hydraulic manifold for the legs of IIT's new hydraulic quadruped robot HyQ2Max. A comparison of this manifold with a traditionally manufactured alternative concludes the paper.},

Design: The saliva mechanically stimulated with parafilm was collected from 25 children (6-12 years) attending the Clinic of Paediatric Dentistry of Universidade Cruzeiro do Sul, São Paulo, Brazil, before (control group) and immediately after application of neutral fluoride gel NaF 2\% (fluoride-gel group), according to the Standards for Research Using Human Subjects, Resolution 196/96 of the USA National Health Council of 10/10/1996. Afterwards, pre-post ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), uric acid, reduced/oxidised glutathione content (GSH/GSSG) and total peroxidase activity (TPO) were evaluated in whole saliva of both groups. Results: All non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters were augmented by fluoride-gel NaF 2\% application, whereas a notable reduction (31\%) of peroxidase activity was concomitantly observed in the children's saliva (p ≤ 0.05). Nevertheless, the reducing power of saliva was kept unaltered under these circumstances (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Despite the reduced activity of peroxidase (an important antimicrobial and antioxidant enzyme), the topical fluoride gel NaF 2\% favourably stimulated the release of non-enzymatic antioxidant components of saliva, sustaining the reducing power of saliva and the natural defences of the oral cavity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We propose a novel method to enhance a family of ICP(iterative closest point) algorithms by updating velocity. Even though ICP algorithms play a dominant role in a model based tracking, it is difficult to avoid an accumulated tracking error during a continuous motion. It is because that typical ICP algorithms assumes that each of the point in one scan are measured simultaneously while most of the available rangefinders measure each point sequentially. Hence conventional ICP algorithms are prone to be erroneous under a fast motion and an accumulated error during the motion cannot be ignored in many cases. In our approach, we estimate a velocity of a rangefinder numerically over ICP iterations. As a result, distortion of a scan due to the motion can be compensated using estimated velocity. In addition, outliers are effectively rejected during the iteration of velocity update, which means that more accurate and robust motion is trackable. Also we verify a performance and an accuracy of our method by demonstrating simulation and real-world experiment results.},

  abstract = {An important problem that arises in many scientific and engineering applications is that of approximating limits of infinite sequences which in most instances converge very slowly. Thus, to approximate limits with reasonable accuracy, it is necessary to compute a large number of terms, and this is in general costly. These limits can be approximated economically and with high accuracy by applying suitable extrapolation (or convergence acceleration) methods to a small number of terms. This book is concerned with the coherent treatment, including derivation, analysis, and applications, of the most useful scalar extrapolation methods. The methods it discusses are geared toward problems that commonly arise in scientific and engineering disciplines. It differs from existing books on the subject in that it concentrates on the most powerful nonlinear methods, presents in-depth treatments of them, and shows which methods are most effective for different classes of practical nontrivial problems; it also shows how to fine-tune these methods to obtain the best numerical results. This state-of-the-art reference on the theory and practice of extrapolation methods will interest mathematicians interested in the theory of the relevant methods as well as giving applied scientists and engineers a practical guide to applying speed-up methods in the solution of difficult computational problems. Avram Sidi is Professor is Numerical Analysis in the Computer Science Department at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and holds the Technion Administration Chair in Computer Science. He has published extensively in various areas of numerical analysis and approximation theory and in journals such as Mathematics of Computation, SIAM Review, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, Journal of Approximation Theory, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Numerische Mathematik, and Journal of Scientific Computing. Professor Sidi's work has involved the development of novel methods, their detailed mathematical analysis, design of efficient algorithms for their implementation, and their application to difficult practical problems.

  abstract = {This paper presents the design of a novel robot capable of climbing on vertical and rough surfaces, such as stucco walls. Termed CLIBO (claw inspired robot), the robot can remain in position for a long period of time. Such a capability offers important civilian and military advantages such as surveillance, observation, search and rescue and even for entertainment and games. The robot's kinematics and motion, is a combination between mimicking a technique commonly used in rock climbing using four limbs to climb and a method used by cats to climb on trees with their claws. It uses four legs, each with four-degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) and specially designed claws attached to each leg that enable it to maneuver itself up the wall and to move in any direction. At the tip of each leg is a gripping device made of 12 fishing hooks and aligned in such a way that each hook can move independently on the wall's surface. This design has the advantage of not requiring a tail-like structure that would press against the surface to balance its weight. A locomotion algorithm was developed to provide the robot with an autonomous capability for climbing along the pre-designed route. The algorithm takes into account the kinematics of the robot and the contact forces applied on the foot pads. In addition, the design provides the robot with the ability to review its gripping strength in order to achieve and maintain a high degree of reliability in its attachment to the wall. An experimental robot was built to validate the model and its motion algorithm. Experiments demonstrate the high reliability of the special gripping device and the efficiency of the motion planning algorithm. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The paper seeks to present a new generation of torque-controlled light-weight robots (LWR) developed at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center. Design/methodology/approach – An integrated mechatronic design approach for LWR is presented. Owing to the partially unknown properties of the environment, robustness of planning and control with respect to environmental variations is crucial. Robustness is achieved in this context through sensor redundancy and passivity-based control. In the DLR root concept, joint torque sensing plays a central role. Findings – In order to act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots have design features and control/software functionalities which distinguish them from classical robots, such as: load-to-weight ratio of 1:1, torque sensing in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive collision detection, compliant control on joint and Cartesian level. Practical implications – The DLR robots are excellent research platforms for experimentation of advanced robotics algorithms. Space and medical robotics are further areas for which these robots were designed and hopefully will be applied within the next years. Potential industrial application fields are the fast automatic assembly as well as manufacturing activities done in cooperation with humans (industrial robot assistant). The described functionalities are of course highly relevant also for the potentially huge market of service robotics. The LWR technology was transferred to KUKA Roboter GmbH, which will bring the first arms on the market in the near future. Originality/value – This paper introduces a new type of LWR with torque sensing in each joint and describes a consistent approach for using these sensors for manipulation in human environments. To the best of one’s knowledge, the first systematic experimental evaluation of possible injuries during robot-human crashes using standardized testing facilities is presented.},

However, most existing solutions focus on finding a collision-free path. Moreover, few of them considers the legged robots, which are believed to find wide applications in human daily life due to their superior mobility in complex artificial environments. In this paper, we propose a novel tactile-based gait planning method for a hexapod robot to pass through crowds in a safe and stable manner. Firstly, we developed a body trajectory generator based on a virtual dynamic model with actual contact force feedback. Then, we developed a leg trajectory planner by taking into account the ZMP stability criterion. In such a way, the contact force can be actively controlled and the stable tripod walking can be realized. We verify our method in simulations and then implement it on the real robot, HexbotIII, for experiments. The experimental results show that with our method the robot can effectively bypass moving humans while regulating the contact force in a safe range.},

One problem related to topology optimization is that the uncertain elements may result when gradient-based search methods are used. Although using binary coding genetic algorithms (GA) can avoid the problem, the problems of structural connectivity and computational cost are the obstacles to be solved. Two novel approaches are proposed in this research to solve these GA-related problems. To ensure the integrity of the topology generated, a weak ground structure is built in the entire design space to play the role of connecting the disconnected material distributed by GA. To reduce the computational cost, a method of reducing the design space by using the result obtained by gradient-based search methods is proposed. A design example shows that applying these two proposed approaches can effectively overcome the problems associated with GA to solve topology optimization problems.},

Next, we obtain the principle of the rotation and direction of the body segments, which are analyzed by determining the geometric features of different configurations. The turning and rotating gaits are then attained by varying only the duration of the transition sequence of the passive-spine hexapod robot. The capability of sideways motion is also given in this paper. Finally, this proposed method for designing the omni-directional gait of a passive-spine hexapod is demonstrated by simulations and experiments.},

The GPU-based filter proceeds in an incremental manner and computes a pseudo-hull that is contained inside the convex hull of the original points. The pseudo-hull computation involves only localized operations and maps well to GPU architectures. Furthermore, the underlying approach extends to high dimensional point sets and deforming points. In practice, our culling filter can reduce the number of candidate points by two orders of magnitude. We have implemented the hybrid algorithm on commodity GPUs, and evaluated its performance on several large point sets. In practice, the GPU-based filtering algorithm can cull up to 85M interior points per second on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580 and the hybrid algorithm improves the overall performance of convex hull computation by 10-27 times (for static point sets) and 22-46 times (for deforming point sets).},

Restricted to the sagittal plane, this behavior exposes a three degree of freedom (DOF) double inverted pendulum with extensible length that can be projected onto the familiar underactuated revolute-revolute "Acrobot" model by assuming a locked prismatic DOF, and a pinned toe. While previous work has documented the successful use of local LQR control to stabilize a physical Acrobot, simulations reveal that a design very similar to those discussed in the past literature cannot achieve an empirically viable controller for our physical plant. Experiments with a series of increasingly close physical facsimiles leading to the actual Minitaur platform itself corroborate and underscore the physical Minitaur platform corroborate and underscore the implications of the simulation study. We conclude that local LQR-based linearized controller designs are too fragile to stabilize the physical Minitaur platform around its vertically erect equilibrium and end with a brief assessment of a variety of more sophisticated nonlinear control approaches whose pursuit is now in progress.}

As legged robots such as quadrupeds are to be deployed in terrains with geometries which are difficult to model and predict, the need arises to equip them with the capability to generalize well to unforeseen situations. In this work, we propose a novel technique for training neural-network policies for terrain-aware locomotion, which combines state-of-the-art methods for model-based motion planning and reinforcement learning. Our approach is centered on formulating Markov decision processes using the evaluation of dynamic feasibility criteria in place of physical simulation. We thus employ policy-gradient methods to independently train policies which respectively plan and execute foothold and base motions in 3D environments using both proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements. We apply our method within a challenging suite of simulated terrain scenarios which contain features such as narrow bridges, gaps and stepping-stones, and train policies which succeed in locomoting effectively in all cases.},

Our new algorithm improves the representation of the contour by 1-D intervals, and achieves afterwards the decomposition of the contour into maximal arcs or segments. Our experiments with synthetic and real images show that our contribution can be employed as a relevant option for noisy shape reconstruction.},

The method evaluates the reduction of joint path and map entropy and computes a potential information field in robot configuration space using these joint entropy reduction estimates.

Very efficient kernel convolution mechanisms are used to evaluate entropy reduction for each sensor ray, and for each possible robot orientation, taking frontiers and obstacles into account. In the end, the computation of this field on the entire configuration space is shown to be very efficient. The approach is tested in simulations in a pair of publicly available datasets comparing favorably both in quality of estimates and in execution time against an RRT∗-based search for the nearest frontier and also against a locally optimal exploration strategy.},

In this paper an improvement of the actuator is proposed where the torque-angle curve and consequently the stiffness-angle curve can be modified by choosing an appropriate shape of a profile disk, which replaces the lever arm of the former design. The actuator has a large joint angle, torque and stiffness range and these properties can be made beneficial for safe human robot interaction and the construction of energy efficient walking, hopping and running robots. The ability to store and release energy is shown by simulations on a 1DOF hopping robot. Its hopping height is much higher compared to a configuration in which the same motor is used in a traditional stiff setup. The stiffness of the actuator has a stiffening characteristic so the leg stiffness resembles more a linear stiffness as found in humans.},

Learning methods, including artificial neural networks, often have difficulties to handle a relatively small number of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show how concepts gained from our intuition on 2- and 3-dimensional data can be misleading when used in high-dimensional settings. When then show how the "curse of dimensionality" and the "empty space phenomenon" can be taken into account in the design of neural network algorithms, and how non-linear dimension reduction techniques can be used to circumvent the problem. We conclude by an illustrative example of this last method on the forecasting of financial time series.},

Exploration can be defined as the task of discovering an unknown region in the space. Most robotic exploration algorithms seek full coverage of the unknown region with data from one sensor (in the underwater domain, it is usually occupancy data from profiling sonars, or optical data from cameras). Our method is able to guide the robot so that full discovery and coverage is obtained in a single exploration for both occupancy data and optical data. Since the algorithm has to run in the AUV's onboard computer, with limited processing power, our method is based around efficient operations that can be performed to an octree data structure. This work extends our previous 2-dimensional (2D) method, which has proved to work in real tests conducted with the Sparus II AUV. In this work, we have used three real datasets to generate environments for its exploration in simulation: an underwater seamount, a shipwreck and an underwater cave. Results using the Girona 500 AUV show the feasibility of our exploration approach in all tested scenarios.},

The information about the class of the terrain allows the robot to work in the real world scenarios more efficiently. In the presented work twelve types of the ground were tested. Suitability of each type of the perception system for characterizing the terrain class was checked. Namely, vision, depth and tactile sensors were used. In each case as a classifier the Support Vector Machines were utilized. The separate classification results from each sensor were combined to obtain better precision and recall in the ground classification process. The information about the terrain type was fed into robot controller to adapt the robot gait parameters. The goal was to achieve good balance between the speed of the movement and the vibration caused by the bounciness and the irregularities of the terrain. The paper begins with the description of the experimental setup. Next, the classification results for each sensor used are presented. Then, the rules of combining classifiers were tested. Finally, the robot gait controller was proposed and evaluated.},

  abstract = {In many camera-based robotics applications, stabilizing video images in real-time is often critical for successful performance. In particular vision-based navigation, localization and tracking tasks cannot be performed reliably when landmarks are blurry, poorly focused or disappear from the camera view due to strong vibrations. Thus a reliable video image stabilization system would be invaluable for these applications. This paper presents a real-time video image stabilization system (VISS) primarily developed for aerial robots. Its unique architecture combines four independent stabilization layers. Layer 1 detects vibrations via an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and performs external counter-movements with a motorized gimbal. Layer 2 damps vibrations by using mechanical devices. The internal optical image stabilization of the camera represents Layer 3, while Layer 4 filters remaining vibrations using software. VISS is low-cost and robust. It has been implemented on a \&\#x201C;Photoship One\&\#x201D; gimbal, using GUMBOT hardware for processing Sparkfun-IMU data (Layer 1). Lord Mount vibration isolators damp vibrations (Layer 2). Video images of Panasonic's Lumix DMCTZ5 camera are optically stabilized with Panasonic's \&\#x201C;Mega O.I.S.\&\#x201D; technique (Layer 3) and digitally stabilized with \&\#x201C;Deshaker\&\#x201D; software (Layer 4). VISS significantly improved the stability of shaky video images in a series of experiments.},

The proposed magnetic wheel solution for robots with such payloads and surface adaptability has not been seen in previous work. As the magnetic force acting on a magnetic wheel is very sensitive to the working conditions, a mathematical model was built to derive the exact force requirements taking into account the mechanical structure of the robot and its disposition on the ship's hull. In this paper, the design of the wheels was optimized based on the model. Wheels were manufactured according to the optimized results and a prototype robot was constructed.

The unit of snake-like robot Perambulator-II robot named as Modular Universal Unit (MUU) is introduced, which behaves three DOFs with a series of passive rollers around its cylinder body. Also, some considerations on mechanism design of snake-like robots are presented. And the shell shape of 3D snake-like robot according to mobility is discussed in detail. The locomotion of Perambulator-II is presented for test its performance. The experimental results are given to validate the mobility of the snake-like robot Perambulator-II. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a wall-climbing robot which adopts passive suction cups as the attaching components. Using only one motor, this robot can not only move on a wall but also attach suction cups to the wall and remove them from the wall. Passive suction cups do not consume additional energy to keep adhesion. Therefore, the proposed robot can realize the climbing motion on a wall with relatively low energy consumption. The prototype has been designed, fabricated and tested. The experiments showed that the proposed robot could attach and remove suction cups passively. However, the robot could not move up the wall well and fell down often. In order to solve this problem, the load of each suction cup when attached to a vertical wall is analyzed. As a result, it is shown that a moment generated by both of the gravity and the attaching force of suction cups turns the robot down from the wall. Then a new model which improves the falling problems is thus designed. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes the concept of drones capable of functioning as 'Co-Archaeologists' that can map large caves and enter dangerous or hard-to-reach spaces. Using RGB-D data collected by drones, we will be able to produce accurate 3D models and semantic maps with proper lighting co-supervised by human archaeologists. This is going to be a major advance in archaeological practice, which can accelerate the speed of archaeological exploits by extending the archaeologists' sight and perception range. This will enable us to conduct 3D analyses so that we may answer new questions and create new insights into the archaeological record. The archaeologists will be able to visualize data collected by drones and instruct the drones' next step in real-time. These data will also be important in site management, data sharing and visualization. Human/drone interaction becomes important, not only for operating the equipment, but also for guiding drones to areas of interest to be mapped. Maps or real-time 'fly-throughs' only make sense when they are organized by human interactions with the space. This human interaction is vital when visualizing and understanding a space and should be reflected in the imagery. We envision that this technology will be game changing in cave mapping and pertinent to anyone rendering interior spaces. It creates longer term impacts in archaeology and digital heritage and potentially creates a transformative way for further enhancing the performance of 3D mapping.},

  abstract = {The convex hull has been extensively studied in computational geometry and its applications have spread over an impressive number of fields. How to find the convex hull is an important and challenging problem. Although many algorithms had been proposed for that, most of them can only tackle the problem in two or three dimensions and the biggest issue is that those algorithms rely on the samples' coordinates to find the convex hull. In this paper, we propose an approximation algorithm named FVDM, which only utilizes the information of the samples' distance matrix to find the convex hull. Experiments demonstrate that FVDM can effectively identify the vertices of the convex hull.},

In this paper, we present an approach for wall collision avoidance using a depth map based on optical flow from on board camera images. An omnidirectional fisheye camera is used as a primary sensor, while IMU data is needed for compensating rotational effects of the optical flow. The here presented approach is designed for safely maneuvering a helicopter through an indoor corridor. Results based on real images taken in a corridor with textured walls are shown at the end of this paper. ©2010 IEEE.},
