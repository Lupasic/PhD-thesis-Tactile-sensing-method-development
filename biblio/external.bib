  abstract = {We explore the use of Evolution Strategies (ES), a class of black box optimization algorithms, as an alternative to popular MDP-based RL techniques such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the authors describe the design and control of RHex, a power autonomous, untethered, compliant-legged hexapod robot. RHex has only six actuators—one motor located at each hip— achieving mechanical simplicity that promotes reliable and robust operation in real-world tasks. Empirically stable and highly maneuverable locomotion arises from a very simple clock-driven, open-loop tripod gait. The legs rotate full circle, thereby preventing the common problem of toe stubbing in the protraction (swing) phase. An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation. RHex achieves fast and robust forward locomotion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body clearance.},

Therefore, in this paper, we intend to evaluate the characteristics of a force-sensitive material—polyethylene-carbon composite (Velostat®) by implementing this material into the design of the flexible tactile sensor. We have explored several possibilities to measure the electrical signal and assessed the mechanical and time-dependent properties of this tactile sensor. The response of the sensor was evaluated by performing tests in static, long-term load and cyclic modes. Experimental results of loading cycle measurements revealed the hysteresis and nonlinear properties of the sensor. The transverse resolution of the sensor was defined by measuring the response of the sensor at different distances from the loaded point. Obtained dependencies of the sensor’s sensitivity, hysteresis, response time, transversal resolution and deformation on applied compressive force promise a practical possibility to use the polyethylene-carbon composite as a sensitive material for sensors with a single electrode pair or its matrix. The results received from experimental research have defined the area of the possible implementation of the sensor based on a composite material—Velostat®.},

Let's talk about the complementary filter and how we can use it to estimate the attitude of a drone using an IMU. It is such a dead simple filter, which is a good reason to learn it, but it’s also practical because it produces nice results when blending measurements from two different sensors.

Errata:
{\textasciitilde}2:23​ - I state that the accelerometer is measuring the acceleration due to gravity, when in fact it's measuring the acceleration caused by the normal force from the ground.  So it's directly up and the exact opposite direction of gravity! Whereas, an accelerometer in free fall would measure no acceleration at all even though it would be accelerating.  So the "convert to angle" block would also take care of this sign flip.

@article{madgwick_ecient_nodate,
	title = {An eﬃcient orientation ﬁlter for inertial and inertial/magnetic sensor arrays},
	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation ﬁlter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The ﬁlter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The beneﬁts of the ﬁlter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each ﬁlter update, (2) eﬀective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters deﬁned by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the ﬁlter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

There are several other subsidiary representations, such as Cayley-Klein parameters and the axis-angle representation, whose relations to the three main representations are also described.

	title = {Feature {Extraction} for {Terrain} {Classiﬁcation} with {Crawling} {Robots}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of terrain classiﬁcation using a technically blind hexapod walking robot. The proposed approach is built on top of the existing method based on analysis of the feedback from the robot’s actuators and the desired trajectory. The formed method uses features for the Support Vector Machine classiﬁcation method that assumes a regular time-invariant gait to control the robot. However, such a gait does not allow the robot to traverse rough terrains, and therefore, it is necessary to consider adaptive motion gait to deal with small obstacles, which is, unfortunately, not a regular gait with some ﬁxed predeﬁned period. Therefore, we propose to alter the features extraction process to utilize the terrain classiﬁcation method also for an adaptive motion gait, which enables the robot to traverse rough terrains. The proposed method has been experimentally veriﬁed on several terrains that are not traversable by a default regular gait. The achieved results not only conﬁrmed the high accuracy of the terrain classiﬁcation as the existing approach, but also expanded the area of operation of a hexapod walking robot into more challenging terrains.},

Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suﬀer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss diﬀerent modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and ﬁltering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman ﬁlter and complementary ﬁlter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},

Different gaits perform best on different types of terrain. Useful measured parameters include the magnitude and timing of the peak normal forces, in combination with the leg rotational velocity. The measured parameters were used in a support vector machine classiﬁer to identify terrain types with 82.5\% accuracy. Based on gait performance studies, we implemented a terrain-based gait control using real-time terrain classiﬁcations.

Next, we obtain the principle of the rotation and direction of the body segments, which are analyzed by determining the geometric features of different configurations. The turning and rotating gaits are then attained by varying only the duration of the transition sequence of the passive-spine hexapod robot. The capability of sideways motion is also given in this paper. Finally, this proposed method for designing the omni-directional gait of a passive-spine hexapod is demonstrated by simulations and experiments.},

This paper considers running legged robots from the RHex family, which the military plans to use in the ﬁeld to assist troops in reconnaissance tasks. Important terrain adaptive behaviors include the selection of gaits, modulation of leg stiﬀness, and alteration of steering control laws that minimize slippage, maximize speed and/or reduce energy consumption. These terrain adaptive behaviors can be enabled by a terrain identiﬁcation methodology that combines proprioceptive sensors already available in RHex-type robots. The proposed classiﬁcation approach is based on the characteristic frequency signatures of data from leg observers, which combine current sensing with a dynamic model of the leg motion. The paper analyzes the classiﬁcation accuracy obtained using both a single leg and groups of legs (through a voting scheme) on diﬀerent terrains such as vinyl, asphalt, grass, and pebbles. Additionally, it presents a terrain classiﬁer that works across various gait speeds and in fact almost as good as an overly specialized classiﬁer.},

	abstract = {This study provides a synthetic viewpoint that compares, contrasts, and draws commonalities for biomimetic perception over a range of tactile sensors and tactile stimuli. Biomimetic active perception is formulated from three principles: (i) evidence accumulation based on leading models of perceptual decision making; (ii) action selection with an evidence-based policy, here based on overt focal attention; and (iii) sensory encoding of evidence based on neural coding. Two experiments with each of three biomimetic tactile sensors are considered: the iCub (capacitive) ﬁngertip, the TacTip (optical) tactile sensor, and BIOTACT whiskers. For each sensor, one experiment considers a similar task (perception of shape and location) and the other a different tactile perception task. In all experiments, active perception with a biomimetic action selection policy based on focal attention outperforms passive perception with static or random action selection. The active perception also consistently reaches superresolved accuracy (hyperacuity) ﬁner than the spacing between tactile elements. Biomimetic active touch thus offers a common approach for biomimetic tactile sensors to accurately and robustly characterize and explore non-trivial, uncertain environments analogous to how animals perceive the natural world.},

In our approach, the robot uses one limb to perform an impact trajectory, while supporting the main body with the remaining three legs. The resulting vibration, which is recorded by sensors placed in the foot, is decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and assigned a soil class by a support vector machine. We tested two foot designs and validated the robustness of this approach through the extensive use of an open-source dataset, which we recorded on a specially designed single-foot testbed. A remarkable overall classiﬁcation accuracy of more than 98\% could be achieved despite various introduced disturbances. The contributions of different sensors to the classiﬁcation performance are evaluated. Finally, we test the generalization performance on unknown soils and show that the interaction behavior can be anticipated.},

Sixty recordings of human subjects traversing rocky trails were analyzed to give a baseline for target patch properties. While the presented system is not designed to select a single foothold, it does ﬁnd a set of patches for possible footholds which are statistically similar to the patches humans select.},

	abstract = {Almost all mammals use their mystacial vibrissae (whiskers) as important tactile sensors. There are no sensors along the length of a whisker: all sensing is performed by mechanoreceptors at the whisker base. To use artiﬁcial whiskers as a sensing tool in robotics, it is essential to be able to determine the three-dimensional (3D) location at which a whisker has made contact with an object. With the assumption of quasistatic, frictionless, single-point contact, previous work demonstrated that the 3D contact point can be uniquely determined if all six components of force and moment are measured at the whisker base, but these measurements require a six-axis load cell. Here, we perform simulations to investigate the extent to which each of the 20 possible ‘‘triplet’’ combinations of the six mechanical signals at the whisker base uniquely determine 3D contact point location. We perform this analysis for four different whisker proﬁles (shapes): tapered with and without intrinsic curvature, and cylindrical with and without intrinsic curvature. We show that whisker proﬁle has a strong inﬂuence on the particular triplet(s) of signals that uniquely map to the 3D contact point. The triplet of bending moment, bending moment direction, and axial force produces unique mappings for tapered whiskers. Four different mappings are unique for a cylindrical whisker without intrinsic curvature, but only when large deﬂections are excluded. These results inform the neuroscience of vibrissotactile sensing and represent an important step toward the development of artiﬁcial whiskers for robotic applications.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new force sensor design approach that maps the local sampling of pressure inside a composite polymeric footpad to forces in three axes, designed for running robots. Conventional multiaxis force sensors made of heavy metallic materials tend to be too bulky and heavy to be ﬁtted in the feet of legged robots, and vulnerable to inertial noise upon high acceleration. To satisfy the requirements for high speed running, which include mitigating high impact forces, protecting the sensors from ground collision, and enhancing traction, these stiff sensors should be paired with additional layers of durable, soft materials; but this also degrades the integrity of the foot structure. The proposed foot sensor is manufactured as a monolithic, composite structure composed of an array of barometric pressure sensors completely embedded in a protective polyurethane rubber layer. This composite architecture allows the layers to provide compliance and traction for foot collision while the deformation and the sampled pressure distribution of the structure can be mapped into three axis force measurement. Normal and shear forces can be measured upon contact with the ground, which causes the footpad to deform and change the readings of the individual pressure sensors in the array. A one-time training process using an artiﬁcial neural network is all that is necessary to relate the normal and shear forces with the multiaxis foot sensor output. The results show that the sensor can predict normal forces in the Z-axis up to 300 N with a root mean squared error of 0.66\% and up to 80 N in the X- and Y -axis. The experiment results demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a lightweight, low cost, yet robust footpad sensor suitable for use in legged robots undergoing ground locomotion.},

To aid in controller selection on different ground types, we show that the robot can measure ground stiffness and friction in-situ by measuring its own interaction with the ground.

This video provides an overview of what sensor fusion is and how it helps in the design of autonomous systems. It also covers a few scenarios that illustrate the various ways that sensor fusion can be implemented.

Sensor fusion is a critical part of localization and positioning, as well as detection and object tracking. We’ll show that sensor fusion is more than just a Kalman filter; it is a whole range of algorithms that can blend data from multiple sources to get a better estimate of the system state. Four of the main benefits of sensor fusion are to improve measurement quality, reliability, and coverage, as well as be able to estimate states that aren’t measure directly. The fact that sensor fusion has this broad appeal across completely different types of autonomous systems is what makes it an interesting and rewarding topic to learn.

The design space for such robots in quite large, with numerous open possibilities for body and leg shapes, conﬁgurations and numbers of components. On the other hand, realistic systems aim toward optimizing various performance measures, some of which can be directly calculated from the design parameters, while others require physical experimentation and simulation. In this paper, we present parametric models of centipede robots as well as rough terrains, and then we evaluate the performance of different robot designs across different terrains. We incrementally derive better designs through an appropriately crafted evolutionary algorithm. Promising results as well as insights are discussed. Finally, we provide a clear list of future steps and a forward-looking conclusion.},

The design space for such robots is quite large, with numerous open possibilities for body and leg shapes, conﬁgurations, and numbers of components. In contrast to similar robotic platforms proposed prototype can move in any direction. Moreover, proposed design allows robot to operate in either omni-direction or conventional states without changing components. It was shown that new design provides better cross-country passability. Structural synthesis of Biomimetic Centipede Robot StriRus was made using evolutionary algorithm and simulation, which includes optimization the number of legs and angles between neighbor legs. Crosschecked angle optimization was done using kinematics.},
