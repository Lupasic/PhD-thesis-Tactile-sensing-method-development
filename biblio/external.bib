  abstract = {We explore the use of Evolution Strategies (ES), a class of black box optimization algorithms, as an alternative to popular MDP-based RL techniques such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the authors describe the design and control of RHex, a power autonomous, untethered, compliant-legged hexapod robot. RHex has only six actuators—one motor located at each hip— achieving mechanical simplicity that promotes reliable and robust operation in real-world tasks. Empirically stable and highly maneuverable locomotion arises from a very simple clock-driven, open-loop tripod gait. The legs rotate full circle, thereby preventing the common problem of toe stubbing in the protraction (swing) phase. An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation. RHex achieves fast and robust forward locomotion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body clearance.},

Therefore, in this paper, we intend to evaluate the characteristics of a force-sensitive material—polyethylene-carbon composite (Velostat®) by implementing this material into the design of the flexible tactile sensor. We have explored several possibilities to measure the electrical signal and assessed the mechanical and time-dependent properties of this tactile sensor. The response of the sensor was evaluated by performing tests in static, long-term load and cyclic modes. Experimental results of loading cycle measurements revealed the hysteresis and nonlinear properties of the sensor. The transverse resolution of the sensor was defined by measuring the response of the sensor at different distances from the loaded point. Obtained dependencies of the sensor’s sensitivity, hysteresis, response time, transversal resolution and deformation on applied compressive force promise a practical possibility to use the polyethylene-carbon composite as a sensitive material for sensors with a single electrode pair or its matrix. The results received from experimental research have defined the area of the possible implementation of the sensor based on a composite material—Velostat®.},

Let's talk about the complementary filter and how we can use it to estimate the attitude of a drone using an IMU. It is such a dead simple filter, which is a good reason to learn it, but it’s also practical because it produces nice results when blending measurements from two different sensors.

Errata:
{\textasciitilde}2:23​ - I state that the accelerometer is measuring the acceleration due to gravity, when in fact it's measuring the acceleration caused by the normal force from the ground.  So it's directly up and the exact opposite direction of gravity! Whereas, an accelerometer in free fall would measure no acceleration at all even though it would be accelerating.  So the "convert to angle" block would also take care of this sign flip.

	title = {An eﬃcient orientation ﬁlter for inertial and inertial/magnetic sensor arrays},
	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation ﬁlter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The ﬁlter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The beneﬁts of the ﬁlter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each ﬁlter update, (2) eﬀective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters deﬁned by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the ﬁlter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

	title = {Feature {Extraction} for {Terrain} {Classiﬁcation} with {Crawling} {Robots}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of terrain classiﬁcation using a technically blind hexapod walking robot. The proposed approach is built on top of the existing method based on analysis of the feedback from the robot’s actuators and the desired trajectory. The formed method uses features for the Support Vector Machine classiﬁcation method that assumes a regular time-invariant gait to control the robot. However, such a gait does not allow the robot to traverse rough terrains, and therefore, it is necessary to consider adaptive motion gait to deal with small obstacles, which is, unfortunately, not a regular gait with some ﬁxed predeﬁned period. Therefore, we propose to alter the features extraction process to utilize the terrain classiﬁcation method also for an adaptive motion gait, which enables the robot to traverse rough terrains. The proposed method has been experimentally veriﬁed on several terrains that are not traversable by a default regular gait. The achieved results not only conﬁrmed the high accuracy of the terrain classiﬁcation as the existing approach, but also expanded the area of operation of a hexapod walking robot into more challenging terrains.},

Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suﬀer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss diﬀerent modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and ﬁltering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman ﬁlter and complementary ﬁlter implementations.

Different gaits perform best on different types of terrain. Useful measured parameters include the magnitude and timing of the peak normal forces, in combination with the leg rotational velocity. The measured parameters were used in a support vector machine classiﬁer to identify terrain types with 82.5\% accuracy.

This paper considers running legged robots from the RHex family, which the military plans to use in the ﬁeld to assist troops in reconnaissance tasks. Important terrain adaptive behaviors include the selection of gaits, modulation of leg stiﬀness, and alteration of steering control laws that minimize slippage, maximize speed and/or reduce energy consumption. These terrain adaptive behaviors can be enabled by a terrain identiﬁcation methodology that combines proprioceptive sensors already available in RHex-type robots. The proposed classiﬁcation approach is based on the characteristic frequency signatures of data from leg observers, which combine current sensing with a dynamic model of the leg motion. The paper analyzes the classiﬁcation accuracy obtained using both a single leg and groups of legs (through a voting scheme) on diﬀerent terrains such as vinyl, asphalt, grass, and pebbles. Additionally, it presents a terrain classiﬁer that works across various gait speeds and in fact almost as good as an overly specialized classiﬁer.},

To this end, roboticists have, in the last few decades, developed several tactile sensing solutions, extensively reported in the literature. Research into interpreting the conveyed tactile information has also started to attract increasing attention in recent years. However, a comprehensive study on this topic is yet to be reported. In an eﬀort to collect and summarize the major scientiﬁc achievements in the area, this survey extensively reviews current trends in robot tactile perception of object properties. Available tactile sensing technologies are brieﬂy presented before an extensive review on tactile recognition of object properties. The object properties that are targeted by this review are shape, surface material and object pose. The role of touch sensing in combination with other sensing sources is also discussed. In this review, open issues are identiﬁed and future directions for applying tactile sensing in diﬀerent tasks are suggested.},

	abstract = {This study provides a synthetic viewpoint that compares, contrasts, and draws commonalities for biomimetic perception over a range of tactile sensors and tactile stimuli. Biomimetic active perception is formulated from three principles: (i) evidence accumulation based on leading models of perceptual decision making; (ii) action selection with an evidence-based policy, here based on overt focal attention; and (iii) sensory encoding of evidence based on neural coding. Two experiments with each of three biomimetic tactile sensors are considered: the iCub (capacitive) ﬁngertip, the TacTip (optical) tactile sensor, and BIOTACT whiskers. For each sensor, one experiment considers a similar task (perception of shape and location) and the other a different tactile perception task. In all experiments, active perception with a biomimetic action selection policy based on focal attention outperforms passive perception with static or random action selection. The active perception also consistently reaches superresolved accuracy (hyperacuity) ﬁner than the spacing between tactile elements. Biomimetic active touch thus offers a common approach for biomimetic tactile sensors to accurately and robustly characterize and explore non-trivial, uncertain environments analogous to how animals perceive the natural world.},

Vision-based approaches have failed to reliably predict soil characteristics in the past, making it necessary to probe the terrain tactilely. We present a robust, haptic inspection approach for a variety of ﬁne, granular media, which are representative of Martian soil. In our approach, the robot uses one limb to perform an impact trajectory, while supporting the main body with the remaining three legs. The resulting vibration, which is recorded by sensors placed in the foot, is decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and assigned a soil class by a support vector machine. We tested two foot designs and validated the robustness of this approach through the extensive use of an open-source dataset, which we recorded on a specially designed single-foot testbed. A remarkable overall classiﬁcation accuracy of more than 98\% could be achieved despite various introduced disturbances. The contributions of different sensors to the classiﬁcation performance are evaluated. Finally, we test the generalization performance on unknown soils and show that the interaction behavior can be anticipated.},

Their sensor values are affected by the crawling gait period, therefore, certain components of the fast Fourier transform over these data are included in the feature vectors as well as remarkable discriminative power is observed for the same scalar statistics of different sensing modalities. The machine learning aspects are analyzed with random forests (RF) because of their stable performance and some inherent, beneficial properties for the model development process. The robustness is evaluated with unseen data after the model accuracy is estimated with cross-validation (CV), and regardless whether a Sony ERS-7 walks barefoot or wears socks, the forests achieve 94\% accuracy. This result outperforms the state of the art techniques for indoor surfaces in the literature and the classification execution is real-time on the robot.

Input is from a 640 × 480 depth camera augmented with a 9-DoF inertial measurement unit to sense the direction of gravity. The system is capable of ﬁnding approximately 700 patches/second on commodity hardware, though the intention is not to ﬁnd as many patches as possible but to reasonably sample upcoming terrain with quality patches. Sixty recordings of human subjects traversing rocky trails were analyzed to give a baseline for target patch properties. While the presented system is not designed to select a single foothold, it does ﬁnd a set of patches for possible footholds which are statistically similar to the patches humans select.},

	abstract = {Almost all mammals use their mystacial vibrissae (whiskers) as important tactile sensors. There are no sensors along the length of a whisker: all sensing is performed by mechanoreceptors at the whisker base. To use artiﬁcial whiskers as a sensing tool in robotics, it is essential to be able to determine the three-dimensional (3D) location at which a whisker has made contact with an object. With the assumption of quasistatic, frictionless, single-point contact, previous work demonstrated that the 3D contact point can be uniquely determined if all six components of force and moment are measured at the whisker base, but these measurements require a six-axis load cell. Here, we perform simulations to investigate the extent to which each of the 20 possible ‘‘triplet’’ combinations of the six mechanical signals at the whisker base uniquely determine 3D contact point location. We perform this analysis for four different whisker proﬁles (shapes): tapered with and without intrinsic curvature, and cylindrical with and without intrinsic curvature. We show that whisker proﬁle has a strong inﬂuence on the particular triplet(s) of signals that uniquely map to the 3D contact point. The triplet of bending moment, bending moment direction, and axial force produces unique mappings for tapered whiskers. Four different mappings are unique for a cylindrical whisker without intrinsic curvature, but only when large deﬂections are excluded. These results inform the neuroscience of vibrissotactile sensing and represent an important step toward the development of artiﬁcial whiskers for robotic applications.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new force sensor design approach that maps the local sampling of pressure inside a composite polymeric footpad to forces in three axes, designed for running robots. Conventional multiaxis force sensors made of heavy metallic materials tend to be too bulky and heavy to be ﬁtted in the feet of legged robots, and vulnerable to inertial noise upon high acceleration. To satisfy the requirements for high speed running, which include mitigating high impact forces, protecting the sensors from ground collision, and enhancing traction, these stiff sensors should be paired with additional layers of durable, soft materials; but this also degrades the integrity of the foot structure. The proposed foot sensor is manufactured as a monolithic, composite structure composed of an array of barometric pressure sensors completely embedded in a protective polyurethane rubber layer. This composite architecture allows the layers to provide compliance and traction for foot collision while the deformation and the sampled pressure distribution of the structure can be mapped into three axis force measurement. Normal and shear forces can be measured upon contact with the ground, which causes the footpad to deform and change the readings of the individual pressure sensors in the array. A one-time training process using an artiﬁcial neural network is all that is necessary to relate the normal and shear forces with the multiaxis foot sensor output. The results show that the sensor can predict normal forces in the Z-axis up to 300 N with a root mean squared error of 0.66\% and up to 80 N in the X- and Y -axis. The experiment results demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a lightweight, low cost, yet robust footpad sensor suitable for use in legged robots undergoing ground locomotion.},

We show that controllers tuned for each surface perform better for each speciﬁc surface type, assessing performance using measurements of 1.) stability of the robot in response to self-disturbances applied by the robot onto itself and 2.) the peak accelerations of the robot that occur during ground impact, which should be minimized to reduce mechanical stress. To aid in controller selection on different ground types, we show that the robot can measure ground stiffness and friction in-situ by measuring its own interaction with the ground. To motivate future work in variable-terrain control and in-situ ground measurement, we show preliminary results of running gaits that transition between hard and soft ground.},

This video provides an overview of what sensor fusion is and how it helps in the design of autonomous systems. It also covers a few scenarios that illustrate the various ways that sensor fusion can be implemented.

Sensor fusion is a critical part of localization and positioning, as well as detection and object tracking. We’ll show that sensor fusion is more than just a Kalman filter; it is a whole range of algorithms that can blend data from multiple sources to get a better estimate of the system state. Four of the main benefits of sensor fusion are to improve measurement quality, reliability, and coverage, as well as be able to estimate states that aren’t measure directly. The fact that sensor fusion has this broad appeal across completely different types of autonomous systems is what makes it an interesting and rewarding topic to learn.

  abstract = {We describe our full body humanoid control approach developed for the simulation phase of the DARPA Robotics Challenge DRC, as well as the modifications made for the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials. We worked with the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot. Our approach was initially targeted at walking, and it consisted of two levels of optimization: a high-level trajectory optimizer that reasons about center of mass and swing foot trajectories, and a low-level controller that tracks those trajectories by solving floating base full body inverse dynamics using quadratic programming. This controller is capable of walking on rough terrain, and it also achieves long footsteps, fast walking speeds, and heel-strike and toe-off in simulation. During development of these and other whole body tasks on the physical robot, we introduced an additional optimization component in the low-level controller, namely an inverse kinematics controller. Modeling and torque measurement errors and hardware features of the Atlas robot led us to this three-part approach, which was applied to three tasks in the DRC Trials in December 2013.},

  abstract = {The local variation of terrain properties causes profound changes in the biosphere, microclimate, hydrologic cycle, and in the distribution of human activities on this planet. With the dawn of computerized technology, the terrain is represented in a digital form and new methods are needed to effectively describe, evaluate and quantify terrain properties. The purpose of this project is to develop new methods and procedures for terrain analyses within a GIS environment. The focus is to develop tools for capturing the local terrain variability. The selected parameters such as the hypsometric integral (modified Martonne's index), roughness index, and basic statistical measures (mean, range and variance) are combined with newly developed dissectivity parameters, drainage lengths and landuse characteristics in one unified package and programmed in GIS using the ARC Macro Language (AML). The digital terrain data from this analysis can then be correlated with other spatial information to determine the influence of terrain properties on the ecosystem or other variables of interest including the human systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel technique for real-time measurement of terrain characteristics and incorporation of this information into the navigation strategy of an autonomous mobile robot. The proposed methodology utilizes a fuzzy logic framework for on-board analysis of terrain traversability, and develops a set of fuzzy navigation rules that guide the rover toward the safest and the most traversable terrain. In addition, a simple goal-seeking behavior is used to drive the rover from its initial position to a user-specified goal position. The overall navigation strategy, consisting of terrain-traverse and goal-seeking behaviors, requires no a priori information about the environment, and uses the on-board traversability analysis to enable the rover to select easy-to-traverse paths to the goal autonomously. The terrain traversability navigation rules are tested and validated with a set of physical rover experiments. These experiments demonstrate the real-time capability of the terrain assessment and fuzzy navigation algorithms.},

  abstract = {A key challenge in autonomous planetary surface exploration is the extraction of meaningful information from sensor data, which would allow a good interpretation of the nearby terrain, and a reasonable assessment of more distant areas. In the last decade, the desire to increase the autonomy of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), particularly in terms of off-road navigation, has significantly increased the interest in the field of automated terrain classification. Although the field is relatively new, its advances and goals are scattered across different robotic platforms and applications. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of the field from a planetary exploration perspective, bringing together the underlying techniques, existing approaches and relevant applications under a common framework. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview to the newcomer in the field, and a structured reference for the practitioners.},

A surface (a two dimensional manifold, in the context of this paper) can be represented as a three dimensional function on a planar disk. In that sense, the triangulation of the disk induces a triangulation of the surface. Hence the emphasis of this paper is on triangulation on a plane. Apart from the issues in triangulation, this survey talks about the known upper and lower bounds on various triangulation problems. It is intended as a broad compilation of known results rather than an intensive treatise, and the details of most algorithms are skipped.},

  abstract = {The power crust is a construction which takes a sample of points from the surface of a three-dimensional object and produces a surface mesh and an approximate medial axis. The approach is to first approximate the medial axis transform (MAT) of the object. We then use an inverse transform to produce the surface representation from the MAT.  This idea leads to a simple algorithm with theoretical guarantees comparable to those of other surface reconstruction and medial axis approximation algorithms. It also comes with a guarantee that does not depend in any way on the quality of the input point sample. Any input gives an output surface which is the `watertight' boundary of a three-dimensional polyhedral solid: the solid described by the approximate MAT. This unconditional guarantee makes the algorithm quite robust and eliminates the polygonalization, hole-filling or manifold extraction post-processing steps required in previous surface reconstruction algorithms.  In this paper, we use the theory to develop a power crust implementation which is indeed robust for realistic and even difficult samples. We describe the careful design of a key subroutine which labels parts of the MAT as inside or outside of the object, easy in theory but non-trivial in practice. We find that we can handle areas in which the input sampling is scanty or noisy by simply discarding the unreliable parts of the MAT approximation. We demonstrate good empirical results on inputs including models with sharp corners, sparse and unevenly distributed point samples, holes, and noise, both natural and synthetic.  We also demonstrate some simple extensions: intentionally leaving holes where there is no data, producing approximate offset surfaces, and simplifying the approximate MAT in a principled way to preserve stable features.},

We consider approximating the MAT of a three-dimensional object, and its complement, with a finite union of balls. Using this approximate MAT we define a new piecewise-linear approximation to the object surface, which we call the power crust. We assume that we are given as input a sufficiently dense sample of points from the object surface. We select a subset of the Voronoi balls of the sample, the polar balls, as the union of balls representation. We bound the geometric error of the union, and of the corresponding power crust, and show that both representations are topologically correct as well. Thus, our results provide a new algorithm for surface reconstruction from sample points. By construction, the power crust is always the boundary of a polyhedral solid, so we avoid the polygonization, hole-filling or manifold extraction steps used in previous algorithms. The union of balls representation and the power crust have corresponding piecewise-linear dual representations, which in some sense approximate the medial axis. We show a geometric relationship between these duals and the medial axis by proving that, as the sampling density goes to infinity, the set of poles, the centers of the polar balls, converges to the medial axis.},

The vertex enumeration problem is to compute V from H{$>$}. The facet enumeration problem is to compute H from V. These two problems are essentially equivalent under point/hyperplane duality. They are among the central computational problems in the theory of polytopes. It is open whether they can be solved in time polynomial in |H| + |V| and the dimension. In this paper we consider the main known classes of algorithms for solving these problems. We argue that they all have at least one of two weaknesses: inability to deal well with “degeneracies”, or, inability to control the sizes of intermediate results. We then introduce families of polytopes that exercise those weaknesses. Roughly speaking, fat-lattice or intricate polytopes cause algorithms with bad degeneracy handling to perform badly; dwarfed polytopes cause algorithms with bad intermediate size control to perform badly. We also present computational experience with trying to solve these problem on these hard polytopes, using various implementations of the main algorithms.},

We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions.

However, parallel implementations of these algorithms are hard to develop and require an in-depth understanding of the language, the compiler and the underlying parallel computer architecture.

In this paper we focus on the convex hull problem, and show that, using our speculative parallelization engine, the sequential algorithm can be automatically executed in parallel, obtaining speedups with as little as four processors, and reaching 5.15x speedup with 28 processors.},

In this paper we offer definitions of density and similarity that work well for high dimensional data (actually, for data of any dimensionality). In particular, we use a similarity measure that is based on the number of neighbors that two points share, and define the density of a point as the sum of the similarities of a point’s nearest neighbors. We then present a new clustering algorithm that is based on these ideas. This algorithm eliminates noise (low density points) and builds clusters by associating non-noise points with representative or core points (high density points). This approach handles many problems that traditionally plague clustering algorithms, e.g., finding clusters in the presence of noise and outliers and finding clusters in data that has clusters of different shapes, sizes, and density. We have used our clustering algorithm on a variety of high and low dimensional data sets with good results, but in this paper, we present only a couple of examples involving high dimensional data sets: word clustering and time series derived from NASA Earth science data.},

This thesis gives a criterion of extrapolation and details tree-based methods to evaluate it. This methodology provides a comprehensible representation of the distribution of training data and a diagnostic for functional behavior in regions of low data density. I then discuss the issue of making predictions at points of extrapolation. I suggest a strategy for stabilizing a general learning algorithm away from training data that is motivated by a Bayesian heuristic not unlike ridge regression and which bears some resemblance to Kriging.  Finally, I advocate a modification to the Functional ANOVA that uses this estimate to avoid the effects of bad extrapolation while retaining many of the useful properties of the decomposition.

The extrapolation model attempts to accurately estimate the high-level trend of the data, which can be extended in a natural way. The constraints of monotonicity and convexity/concavity play an important role in restricting the choice of the high level-trend, which otherwise would remain rather arbitrary. Our extrapolation model incorporates these constraints in multiple dimensions. We describe the trend as a nonnegative linear combination of twice-integrated multivariate B-splines and their variations. The specific basis functions in our approach are chosen so that any such combination is a plausible a priori model. As a result, basis function coefficients can be optimized to best fit the data without losing control over the high-level trend of the extrapolation model. Our approach also allows the use of standard model selection techniques. We illustrate this by applying cross-va...},

  abstract = {There has historically been very little concern with extrapolation in Machine Learning, yet extrapolation can be critical to diagnose. Predictor functions are almost always learned on a set of highly correlated data comprising a very small segment of predictor space. Moreover, flexible predictors, by their very nature, are not controlled at points of extrapolation. This becomes a problem for diagnostic tools that require evaluation on a product distribution. It is also an issue when we are trying to optimize a response over some variable in the input space. Finally, it can be a problem in non-static systems in which the underlying predictor distribution gradually drifts with time or when typographical errors misrecord the values of some predictors.We present a diagnosis for extrapolation as a statistical test for a point originating from the data distribution as opposed to a null hypothesis uniform distribution. This allows us to employ general classification methods for estimating such a test statistic. Further, we observe that CART can be modified to accept an exact distribution as an argument, providing a better classification tool which becomes our extrapolation-detection procedure. We explore some of the advantages of this approach and present examples of its practical application.},

Yet existing statistical strategies provide few reliable means of identifying extreme counterfactuals. We offer a proof that inferences farther from the data allow more model dependence and then develop easyto-apply methods to evaluate how model dependent our answers would be to specified counterfactuals. These methods require neither sensitivity testing over specified classes of models nor evaluating any specific modeling assumptions. If an analysis fails the simple tests we offer, then we know that substantive results are sensitive to at least some modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence.

In effect, with the exception of a posteriori adjustments of the expansion components, the definition of this parameter is the only way of improving the approximation at a finite distance from the initial point. Good parametrization equations are usually obtained by norms that involve all variables of the problem or based on the nature of the mechanical phenomena. Here this equation is constructed following the criteria of reducing the residual error and at the same time exactly reproducing solutions that admit a polynomial second degree representation. That choice is automatic in the analysis and improves the domain of accurate approximations. An appropriate predictor–corrector scheme was implemented to compare extrapolations obtained by this and several standard parametrizations. The solution scheme was used to analyse geometrically nonlinear plane frame structures.},

Here k is the number of regressor variables used to build the regression model. This method has an advantage over the other methods used in the literature for the determination of extrapolation, in that, whenever a new point is indeed an extrapolation point, the developed method identifies it as an extrapolation, while the other methods may fail to identify it as an extrapolation point.},

Two of these generalize the notions of the orthogonal convex hull of an orthogonal polygon and the traditional “bounding box” of a polygon. Three of the hulls have worst-case time complexity Θ(n + f) and worst case space complexity θ(n) space, where n is the number of edges of a given polygon and f (≥2) is the number of allowed orientations. We also show that testing whether an arbitrary simple polygon is (finitely oriented) convex has worst-case time and space complexity θ(n + f) and θ(n), respectively.},

  author = {Sidi, Avram},
  date = {2003-06-05},
  abstract = {An important problem that arises in many scientific and engineering applications is that of approximating limits of infinite sequences which in most instances converge very slowly. Thus, to approximate limits with reasonable accuracy, it is necessary to compute a large number of terms, and this is in general costly. These limits can be approximated economically and with high accuracy by applying suitable extrapolation (or convergence acceleration) methods to a small number of terms. This book is concerned with the coherent treatment, including derivation, analysis, and applications, of the most useful scalar extrapolation methods. The methods it discusses are geared toward problems that commonly arise in scientific and engineering disciplines. It differs from existing books on the subject in that it concentrates on the most powerful nonlinear methods, presents in-depth treatments of them, and shows which methods are most effective for different classes of practical nontrivial problems; it also shows how to fine-tune these methods to obtain the best numerical results. This state-of-the-art reference on the theory and practice of extrapolation methods will interest mathematicians interested in the theory of the relevant methods as well as giving applied scientists and engineers a practical guide to applying speed-up methods in the solution of difficult computational problems. Avram Sidi is Professor is Numerical Analysis in the Computer Science Department at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and holds the Technion Administration Chair in Computer Science. He has published extensively in various areas of numerical analysis and approximation theory and in journals such as Mathematics of Computation, SIAM Review, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, Journal of Approximation Theory, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Numerische Mathematik, and Journal of Scientific Computing. Professor Sidi's work has involved the development of novel methods, their detailed mathematical analysis, design of efficient algorithms for their implementation, and their application to difficult practical problems. His methods and algorithms are successfully used in various scientific and engineering disciplines.},

Most of the algorithms examined are designed for good performance on uniformly distributed sites. However, we also test implementations of these algorithms on a number of non-uniform distibutions. The experiments go beyond measuring total running time, which tends to be machine-dependent. We also analyze the major high-level primitives that algorithms use and do an experimental analysis of how often implementations of these algorithms perform each operation.},

Our formulation uses a GPU-based interior point filter to cull away many of the points that do not lie on the boundary. The convex hull of remaining points is computed on a CPU. The GPU-based filter proceeds in an incremental manner and computes a pseudo-hull that is contained inside the convex hull of the original points. The pseudo-hull computation involves only localized operations and maps well to GPU architectures. Furthermore, the underlying approach extends to high dimensional point sets and deforming points. In practice, our culling filter can reduce the number of candidate points by two orders of magnitude. We have implemented the hybrid algorithm on commodity GPUs, and evaluated its performance on several large point sets. In practice, the GPU-based filtering algorithm can cull up to 85M interior points per second on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580 and the hybrid algorithm improves the overall performance of convex hull computation by 10-27 times (for static point sets) and 22-46 times (for deforming point sets).},

When then show how the "curse of dimensionality" and the "empty space phenomenon" can be taken into account in the design of neural network algorithms, and how non-linear dimension reduction techniques can be used to circumvent the problem. We conclude by an illustrative example of this last method on the forecasting of financial time series.},
